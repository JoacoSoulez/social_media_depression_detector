# Social media depression detector

## Motivation

There are more than 280 million people in the world diagnosed with depression, and social networks have been proven to play a crucial role in the increase of cases. That is why I developed this Naive Bayes model to identify according to the text, if the user suffers from depression or not.

## Method
I have used a twitter database with (2345 tweets) information of people who have a tendency to suffer from this disease, and contrasted it with a selection of positive tweets extracted from a twitter database with more than 1.6 million tweets analyzed according to their sentiment (positive negative).
Then, I also used a reddit database of posts in a subforum where people with depression write.
