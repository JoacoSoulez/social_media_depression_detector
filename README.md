There are more than 280 million people in the world diagnosed with depression. It is estimated that the advent of social media and the covid-19 pandemic have fueled the increase in cases of depression. Today, access to quality mental health diagnosis and follow-up is taboo and difficult to access. The idea is, through an analysis of their posts on Twitter, to be able to detect which users have a tendency to fall into depressive disorders, in order to prevent this disease.

# Method


To do this, and following the line of several researchers, we have made a Machine Learning model that we have trained with a database of tweets about depression.
