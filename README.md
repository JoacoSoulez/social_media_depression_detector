There are more than 280 million people in the world diagnosed with depression. It is estimated that the advent of social media and the covid-19 pandemic have fueled the increase in cases of depression. Today, access to quality mental health diagnosis and follow-up is taboo and difficult to access. The idea is, through an analysis of their posts on Twitter, to be able to detect which users have a tendency to fall into depressive disorders, in order to prevent this disease.

# Method


To do this, and following the line of several researchers, we have made a Machine Learning model that we have trained with a database of tweets about depression.

## Motivation

There are more than 280 million people in the world diagnosed with depression, and social networks have been proven to play a crucial role in the increase of cases. That is why I developed this Naive Bayes model to identify according to the text, if the user suffers from depression or not.

## Method
I have used a twitter database with (2345 tweets) information of people who have a tendency to suffer from this disease, and contrasted it with a selection of positive tweets extracted from a twitter database with more than 1.6 million tweets analyzed according to their sentiment (positive negative).
Then, I also used a reddit database of posts in a subforum where people with depression write.
